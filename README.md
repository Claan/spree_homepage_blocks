===================

Extension for spree which allows the admin to choose advertisement blocks to put in the homepage.
The advertisement blocks are comprised of a promo image and a link (external or internal).


Installation
------------

Add spree_homepage_blocks to your Gemfile:

```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle

```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.
